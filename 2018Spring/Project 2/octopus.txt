The octopus is a soft-bodied, eight-armed mollusk of the order Octopoda. Around three hundred species are recognized and the order is grouped within the class Cephalopoda with squids, cuttlefish and nautiloids. Like other cephalopods, the octopus is bilaterally symmetric with two eyes and a beak, with its mouth at the centre point of the arms. Octopuses inhabit various regions of the ocean, including coral reefs, pelagic waters, and the seabed, some live in the intertidal zone and others at abyssal depths.
