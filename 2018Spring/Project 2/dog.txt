Today I saw dog and it was an pug!  The owner told me the name of the dog was Thomas.  The owner told me Thomas likes to go on long walks.  However, sometimes Thomas likes to go jump in the fountain and the Owner maybe a little displeased.  One of the tricks up Thomasâ€™ sleeve is that Thomas likes to play chest and considers himself a grand master.  Thomas is a lovely pug with short brown fur, and brings joy to everyone that comes through his life!
