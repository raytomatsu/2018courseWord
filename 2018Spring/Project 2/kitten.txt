Cats are the second most popular pets in the United States.  I was fortunate enough to interview a cat owner.  The owner told me her cat is a Chinese hairless and that the catâ€™s name is Lia.  The owner said Lia likes purr when she is hungry.  Cats are very independent and their unique behavior is adored by many!
